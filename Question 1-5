Spring Homework 2-week one 

Q1/

The output/
“hey from Massage 1”

The Discretion / 
- We add a @Bean annotation above the method so the spring invokes it and implements it.
- there is one Bean so It is definitely the only one that will be implemented.

Q2/

The output/
“hey from Massage 1”
“hey from Massage 2”

The Discretion / 
- We add a @Bean annotation above the methods so the spring invokes it and implements it.
- There are two beans the second bean receives the value of String so we defined it will receive a value coming from the first bean by using @Qualifier(“1”) annotation.
- We give priority to bean number one to implement first by using @Qualifier annotation so always Massage 1 will implement first and then massage 2.

Q3/

The output may be /  
Case 1 :   
hey from message 1
hey from message 3
hey from message 2


Case 2:   
hey from message 3
hey from message 2
hey from message 1

Case 3:    
hey from message 3
hey from message 1
hey from message 2

The Discretion / 
- there is no priority between message 1 and  message 3 any one of them can implement first and as well as for message 1, message 2
- But message 2 will always implement after message 3 because we add @Qualifier(“3”)as a parameter in message 2 as well as we annotated massage 3 with @Qualifier(“3”) so the Spring will take the value returned from message 3 and put it as a parameter in message 2.

Q4/

The output may be /  
Case 1 :   
hey from message 1
hey from message 3
hey from message 2


Case 2:   
hey from message 3
hey from message 2
hey from message 1

Case 3:    
hey from message 3
hey from message 1
hey from message 2

The Discretion / 
- First, The Spring does not invoke and implement the MainController Method because is not annotated as @Bean
- there is no priority between message 1 and  message 3 any one of them can implement first and as well as for message 1, message 2
- But message 2 will always implement after message 3 because we add @Qualifier(“3”)as a parameter in message 2 as well as we annotated massage 3 with @Qualifier(“3”) so the Spring will take the value returned from message 3 and put it as a parameter in message 2.

Q5/

The output may be /  
Case 1 :   
hey from message 1
hey from message 3
hey from message 2


Case 2:   
hey from message 3
hey from message 2
hey from message 1

Case 3:    
hey from message 3
hey from message 1
hey from message 2

The Discretion / 
- First, The Spring does not invoke and implement the MainController Method because is not annotated as @Bean
- there is no priority between message 1 and  message 3 any one of them can implement first and as well as for message 1, message 2
